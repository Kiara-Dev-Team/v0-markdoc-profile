> A modern, accessible documentation and customer portal built with Markdoc and Next.js

## 🎯 What We Do

Kiara Customer Hub is a centralized platform designed to provide our customers with easy access to:

- **Documentation & Guides** - Comprehensive resources to help you get the most out of our services
- **Support Resources** - Quick access to troubleshooting guides and FAQs
- **Product Information** - Up-to-date information about our offerings and features
- **Community Hub** - A space for customers to connect, learn, and grow together

We transform complex technical information into clear, beautiful, and accessible content that empowers our customers to succeed.

## 💡 Why We Do It

**Better Customer Experience**: We believe that great documentation is the foundation of customer success. Traditional documentation often feels disconnected, hard to navigate, and difficult to maintain.

Our customer hub solves these problems by:

- ✨ **Improving accessibility** - Making information easy to find and understand for everyone
- 🚀 **Enhancing user experience** - Providing a modern, intuitive interface that users love
- 📝 **Streamlining content management** - Using Markdoc for maintainable, version-controlled documentation
- 🔄 **Staying current** - Automatic deployments ensure content is always up-to-date
- 🤝 **Building community** - Creating a central place for customers to engage with our brand

## 🛠️ How We Do It

### Technology Stack

We use modern, proven technologies to deliver the best experience:

- **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)** - React framework for production-grade applications
- **[Markdoc](https://markdoc.dev/)** - Powerful, flexible Markdown-based authoring framework
- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)** - Type-safe code for better reliability
- **[Vercel](https://vercel.com/)** - Automatic deployments and edge network delivery
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** - Modern, utility-first styling

### Content Architecture
