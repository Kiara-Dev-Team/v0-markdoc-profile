It naturally goes away after few hours because the peak does not last long.(Long answer)This might come from our “technical debt” due to the database structure.We have monthly strategic plan to keep cleaning it regularly.Frankly we see much less errors in 2025 compared with 2024.Among several reasons, we are guessing this error happens when dealing with high volume at the same time, due to the slight time lag in between our system and slack api, slack api might have been calling our system twice by thinking our system is failing to return correct data.",
